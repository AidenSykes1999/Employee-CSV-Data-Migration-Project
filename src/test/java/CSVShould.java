    // Read file Employee.CSV
    //  add each record read to a new object of a suitable class and then add those objects to a collection
    // Any corrupt or duplicated data should be added to a separate collection for further analysis.
    // Consider which date class would be best to use for the date fields – there is one in java.util and another in java.sql.
    // Provide a simple user interface to display the results of reading the file – how many unique, clean records there are, how many duplicates, how many records with missing fields, possibly display the questionable records.
    // Since the overall purpose of the project is data migration, we want to make sure that only clean data is transferred.
