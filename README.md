### About the Project

This project has been developed as a team of four during the span of a week. We split our workload and co-ordinated our meetings by the use of agile methodology.




The project's functionality includes being able to read, validate and write CSV Files to databases.

### Project Tour

* Phase 1 : We Created Employee-CSV-Data-Migration-Project and write code to read data from an Employee CSV file.Corrupt or duplicated data and records with missing fields,              added to a separate collection for analysis i.e TestCorruptedData.csv,TestDuplicatedData.csv files and TestMissingValuesData.csv file and testes the files with the            help JUnit.
* Duplicate Data

 * Missing Values
              ![MissingValues](MissingValues.png)
 * CorruptData
               ![CorruptData](CorruptData.png)
 * Duplicate Data
                ![UniqueData](DuplicateData.png)
             
* Phase 2 : Used MySQL Database and create a connection and transefering dates from JAVA to SQL. 
* Create database  from JAVA to Mysql

* Create Database

* comparing the execution time

* Phase 3 : Implementing multiple threads to write the data and comparing the execution time. 
* Create Database From Java To SQL
 ![Create Database](CreateDatabase.png)
* Phase 4 : Modified code to make use of functional programming concepts â€“ lambdas and streams.

### JUnit Testing

JUnit testing allows us to test the model methods of the project without having to participate in lengthy manual testing.

Effecient use of JUnit Tests will allow us to maintain our program to ensure that it works without any error.

We can find errors by asserting  results and comparing it to the actual result|

Looking at our test coverage, the average % of code coverage is being dragged down by classes that are deprecated. The classes which see most use within the main methods of our project have exceedingly high coverage


### Future Developments

Outside of the time given for this project, we would like to implement a more user-friendly design. This shall allow users to select what outputs they desire such as the amount of corrupted data rather than getting all data.
