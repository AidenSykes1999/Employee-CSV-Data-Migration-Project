### About the Project

This project has been developed as a team of four during the span of a week. We split our workload and co-ordinated our meetings by the use of agile methodology.




The project's functionality includes being able to read, validate and write CSV Files to databases.

### Project Tour

#### Phase 1 : Created Employee-CSV-Data-Migration-Project and wrote code to read data from a CSV file. Corrupt or duplicated data and records with missing fields,              added to a separate collection for analysis i.e TestCorruptedData.csv,TestDuplicatedData.csv files and TestMissingValuesData.csv file and testes the files with the            help JUnit.

* Missing Values

* Corrupt Data
              ![CorruptData](CorruptData.png)
             
#### Phase 2 : Used MySQL Database and created a connection and transferred dates from JAVA to SQL. 
* Created database  from JAVA to Mysql
![Main Method](CreateDatabase.png)

#### Phase 3 : Implemented multiple threads to write the data and compared the execution time. 

* Comparison of the execution time

#### Phase 4 : Modified code to make use of functional programming concepts â€“ lambdas and streams.

### JUnit Testing

JUnit testing allows us to test the model methods of the project without having to participate in lengthy manual testing.

Effecient use of JUnit Tests will allow us to maintain our program to ensure that it works without any error.

We can find errors by asserting  results and comparing it to the actual result.

Looking at our test coverage, the average % of code coverage is being dragged down by code unsuitable for unit testing. The classes which see most use within the main method of our project have exceedingly high coverage

### Manual Testing

The parts of the program which were not suitable for unit testing were
tested manually multiple times. E.g. user input was tested by entering wrong
values and then trying to make it impossible for the user to break the code by doing so.

The console interface was also heavily tested by trying to input all
possible combinations and incorrect values. Every part of the interface was
tested to check whether the design stayed consistent. This part required
many adjustments as the interface used many classes and methods written by
more than one person.

### Future Developments

Outside the time given for this project, we would like to implement a more user-friendly design. This shall allow users to select what outputs they desire such as the amount of corrupted data rather than getting all data.
